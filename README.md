# LMHT - HTML: Lenguaje de Marca de Hipertexto - Hyper Text Markup Language
Hey
Welcome to [LMHT].  This is an open source code repository to help Spanish speakers translate and understand HTML tags.  LMHT was originally started as a [YWebCA] project by Team Open Brace in the Summer of 2015. [Adorable] and other contributors are working towards expanding this project into a valuable learning tool for bilingual programmers.

## Introduction

The [LMHT page] provides a list of current HTML tags.  Begin by typing a tag in the search box, or click the button to see all available tags.  Once you have selected a tag, you will see the English base of the tag, the Spanish equivalent, a definition in both English and Spanish and audio recordings of each definition and tag.  Furthermore, there are helpful hints on how to remember what the tag does, as well as examples of the tag being used in code.

## Known Issues

* Attributes: Currently, in the beginning stages, the focus is to define the primary HTML tags.  Eventually, this site will also define the attributes associated with each of these tags.
* Formatting: As the page develops there will be periodic formatting issues that come up. You may create an issue on Github or contact us via email to notify us.
* Missing or incorrect information:  As an open source project, it will take time to acquire a significant database, as well as having completed definitions.  Some translations or audio recordings may be missing, so we would love your help in further developing this project.
