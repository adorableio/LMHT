# LMHT - HTML: Lenguaje de Marca de Hipertexto - Hyper Text Markup Language

Welcome to [LMHT].  This is an open source code repository for a website that helps Spanish speakers translate and understand HTML tags. Originally started as a project by Team Open Brace in the [YWebCA] Summer 2015 cohort, this project is now being developed further by [Adorable] as an open source project to expand its possibilities. With your help we can expand this into an excellent learning tool for bilingual programmers.

## Introduction

The [LMHT site] provides a list of current HTML tags. Select the tag you are looking for or begin typing it in the search box. Once selected, an embedded window will appear, containing the English base of the tag, the Spanish equivalent, a definition in both English and Spanish, as well as audio recordings of each of these items.  Furthermore, there are helpful hints on how to remember what the tag does as well as examples of the code being used.

## Known Issues

* *Attributes:* Currently, in these beginning stages, the focus has been on creating the primary HTML tags. Eventually this will expand to cover attributes associated with each of these tags.
* *Formatting:* As the page develops there will be periodic formatting issues that come up. Please report them as you see them or submit fixes.
* *Missing or incorrect information:* As an open source project, it will take time to acquire a significant database, as well as have fully completed definitions (including translations and audio recordings). Please report issues or send fixes for any that you find so they can be addressed as quickly as possible.
